## NI-DM export for FSL

Export of FSL statistical results using [NI-DM 0.1.0](http://nidm.nidash.org/specs/Results_NIDM_Spec.html).

To do:
- Can we retreive FSL software version (and not feat version) from a feat directory?
- Test with F-contrasts
- Test with different configurations of thresholding
