## NI-DM export for FSL

Export of FSL results using NI-DM

To do:
- Check which sha sum algorithm should be used (and consistency with SPM export).
- Can we retreive FSL software version (and not feat version) from a feat directory?
- Test with F-contrasts
- Test with different configurations of thresholding
